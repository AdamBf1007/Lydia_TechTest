Feature: Wikipedia app navigation

  Scenario: Open Lydia and Crésus pages
    Given the Wikipedia app is launched
    When I swipe through the carousel
    And I click on "Get Started"
    And I search for "Lydia"
    And I dismiss the popup
    And I change the language to "Français"
    And I scroll to the bottom of the page
    And I open "Crésus" in a new tab
    Then I should see the Crésus page
